My dear Osi the Billi,

Truly, you're my partner in crime. I mean, what haven't we done together?! Every mischief we've gotten into has been a riot. But you, you little piece of... Billi, you just had to mess up my reputation in front of your mommah. Forget it. So, what I'm trying to say is... should I? Don't freak out when you hear this, okay?

So, thank you for being born. Thank you for existing. You really don't know how much you mean to me. To us. Actually, it was you who healed my broken heart after it shattered dealing with those toxic people at school. And thank you for making me believe that I'm not unlucky in friendship. I have people like you to call my friends too. Well, I should've written this to both Pol and you, but gwenchana, gwenchana... But in the end, I just want to say thanks for being here; your presence means the world to me. Am I getting too mushy? Nour, I'm not. And you're one of the strongest women I've ever met. I know you've been through a lot, and I believe in you. Better days are coming, Insha Allah. Don't lose hope; I'm with you, whether by your side or in my prayers, but I'm with you. Don't worry, I'm not leaving you anytime soon. I can't wait to tell your kiddo what a goofball you were, oops, still are... then we can all laugh about it together. And hey, let's plan a trip after you tie the knot. Bhai, I won't keep writing. Okay, Tata.

          <br /><br />
